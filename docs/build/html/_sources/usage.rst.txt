Usage
=====

Instalation
-----------
To use InmetPy, install it with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install inmetpy


Getting Started
===============

List stations
-------------

.. exec_code::
   :linenos:

   from inmetpy.inmet_stations import InmetStation 

   inmet = InmetStation()

   print(inmet.stations.head(10).to_markdown())


The ´inmet´ object contains a list of all stations available at
the INMET API, since the first convetional stations to the modern ones.

It has two types of stations, "Automatic" stations ("A") and "Traditional" stations ("M", from "Manual").

To get filter out just the automatic stations:

.. exec_code::
   :linenos:

   from inmetpy.inmet_stations import InmetStation 

   inmet = InmetStation()

   automatic_stations = inmet.get_auto_stations()

   print(automatic_stations.head(10).to_markdown())
   print(len(automatic_stations))


Search Stations
---------------

It is possible to search stations following either two criterias,
the state (or states) that wanted to search or search the closest
n stations near by a given location.

.. exec_code::
   :linenos:
   :caption: Search stations by state

   from inmetpy.inmet_stations import InmetStation 

   inmet = InmetStation()

   # Looking for stations in the Amazonas and Rio de Janeiro states.
   states = ["AM","RJ"]

   stations = inmet.search_station_by_state(states)

   print(stations.head(5).to_markdown())


.. exec_code::
   :linenos:
   :caption: Search stations by coordinates

   from inmetpy.inmet_stations import InmetStation 

   inmet = InmetStation()

   # Looking for stations in the Amazonas and Rio de Janeiro states.
   states = ["AM","RJ"]

   stations = inmet.search_station_by_coords(lat=-22.4212, lon=-42.4518, n_stations = 2)

   print(stations.head(5).to_markdown())
